<h2>Exotic Petting Zoo</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The player owns a petting zoo, and must venture out to various locations to acquire animals to add to their petting zoo.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should come to have a greater appreciation of animals, but I'm not sure what else the player should experience other than that in this prototype at least, since there isn't much time to develop anything in depth.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
JRPG style top-down adventure game with RPG aspects
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player will need to use arrow key or WASD movement (undecided at the moment) to navigate areas, and must use the mouse to interact with animals and pick up items that are used to “tame” them. There will be toggles for listing instructions and pulling up an inventory GUI. For example, the player can press "i" to make a list of instructions on game play, story, etc. or they can press "e" to pull up a basic inventory GUI which the player will need to interact with their mouse to use items and such that they pick up along the way.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This is essentially a rough draft of the game I want to develop for the rest of the semester, and will have to demo the use of game states, some GUI for inventory, effectively using mouse and keyboard inputs, while all being smooth and efficient while being run.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Extensive use of mouse input as well as a functioning interactive GUI are important features of this prototype and must be implemented. At some point, there must also be a way to implement multiple different tilemaps as states, since the player will have to travel to different themed areas.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The location of the petting zoo is next to a train station, which the player will use to navigate to different regions and climates in search of exotic animals to bring back. Each of the areas will have different animals and different requirements to “tame” them. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You have inherited a rundown petting zoo from your late uncle, which used to be a worldwide attraction. You feel compelled to bring back his zoo to its former glory so you must procure new, exotic animals to draw in crowds.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Most likely people ages 8+, geared towards animal lovers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Will be able to estimate play time better when the prototype actually functions and runs properly. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Being alert and being quick in testing how to tame different animals is an important part of playing the game effectively.
</li>

    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The only game that is similar in mechanics that comes to mind is Slime Rancher, which is a game where the player goes out and collects different types of slimes, which produce currency for the player to use to buy items and unlock new areas. Story-wise, I drew inspiration from Stardew Valley. In Stardew Valley, you (the player) inherit a rundown farm in a small rural area and you must tend the farm and interact with the other residents of Stardew Valley.
