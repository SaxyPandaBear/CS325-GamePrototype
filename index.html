<h2>Exotic Petting Zoo</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Venture out to various locations to acquire animals to add to your petting zoo, while learning about them.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should come to have a greater appreciation of animals, as well as basic information about different animals but I'm not sure what else the player should experience other than that in this prototype at least, since there isn't much time to develop anything in depth.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
JRPG style top-down adventure game with RPG aspects
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can explore their own petting zoo, where their currently owned animals live, or they can head out to the station which lets them go out and explore different areas such as caves, meadows, jungles, oceans, and even the moon - it's a very elaborate train station. The player's inventory will be used to store items that the player will need to use in order to capture animals in the different areas that they will see. The catch is that the player will only have a limited space for holding items.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This is essentially a rough draft of the game I want to develop for the rest of the semester, and will have to demo the use of game states, some GUI for inventory, effectively using mouse and keyboard inputs, while all being smooth and efficient while being run.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Animated animal sprites that respond to player interaction differently depending on how the player approaches them. For example:
    <ul>
        <li>If the player has not met conditions for taming an animal, the animal will respond with a sound and will move away from the player.</li>
        <li>If they player HAS met conditions, however, the animal will respond with a sound, animation, and the player will be notified of what animal they acquired.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>Acquiring animals will unlock a 'journal entry' where the player logs details about that animal's behavior and diet. The player can then open up this journal to learn about each animal.
    </li>
    
    <li>Multiple different regions for the player to explore.
    </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The location of the petting zoo is next to a train station, which the player will use to navigate to different regions and climates in search of exotic animals to bring back. Each of the areas will have different animals and different requirements to “tame” them. For instance, there will be a cave, in which there is a maze, and at the end of the maze is a sleeping dragon. You (the player) must look at different items scattered throughout the cave that you will need in order to wake up the dragon to bring it back to your zoo.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Your beloved great-uncle has passed away and in his will he has left you ownership of something peculiar... A petting zoo. You learn that your great-uncle used to run a world-renowned exotic petting zoo, but as the years progressed the petting zoo declined in its popularity. In his will, he says that you can do anything you want with the property, including tearing it down. In a moment of unadulterated emotion, you feel compelled to take it on yourself to restore the zoo to its former glory. Little do you know, a large corporation has their eye on your newly inherited property, and are due to seize it from you if the zoo continues to perform as poorly as it has.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People ages 8+, geared towards animal lovers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Will be able to estimate play time better when the prototype actually functions and runs properly. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Being alert and being quick in testing how to tame different animals is an important part of playing the game effectively.
</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The only game that is similar in mechanics that comes to mind is Slime Rancher, which is a game where the player goes out and collects different types of slimes, which produce currency for the player to use to buy items and unlock new areas. Story-wise, I drew inspiration from Stardew Valley. In Stardew Valley, you (the player) inherit a rundown farm in a small rural area and you must tend the farm and interact with the other residents of Stardew Valley.
